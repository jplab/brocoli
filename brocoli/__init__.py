BRoCoLi - LImit ROots of COxeter groups (eternal Beta version)
===============================================================


This is a package to experiment with limit roots and related objects of
geometric representations of Coxeter groups.

With this package you can compute the following:

  - Roots
  - Weights
  - Elements of the group (as matrices)
  - Bilinear form and its signature

For Lorentzian Coxeter groups:

  - Elliptic, Parabolic and Hyperbolic elements
  - limit roots coming from parabolic and hyperbolic elements

You can also visualize:

  - Affine positive cone
  - Isotropic cone
  - roots
  - weights
  - limit roots
  - Tits cone

For rank 3 Coxeter groups, you can obtain tikzpicture of the above structures.
